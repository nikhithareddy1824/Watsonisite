            <h1>BITCOIN</h1>
        <p1>Bitcoin is a digital currency which operates free of any central control or the oversight of banks or governments.<br> Instead it relies on peer-to-peer software and cryptography.

            A public ledger records all bitcoin transactions and copies are held on servers around the world.<br> Every ten minutes or so these transactions are collected together by miners into a group called a block and added permanently to the blockchain.<br>
            Bitcoins can currently be subdivided by seven decimal places: a thousandth of a<br> bitcoin is known as a milli and <br>a hundred millionth of a bitcoin is known as a satoshi.<br>
            </p1>       
        <p3>Bitcoin can be exchanged for cash just like any asset. <br>There are numerous cryptocurrency<br> exchanges online where people can <br>do this but transactions can also be carried out in<br> person or over any communications platform, allowing even <br>small businesses to accept bitcoin. There is no official mechanism<br> built into bitcoin to convert to another currency.<br>
    Bitcoin was created as a way for people to send money over the internet.<br> The digital currency was intended to provide an alternative payment system <br>that would operate free of central control but otherwise<br> be used just like traditional currencies.</p3>
