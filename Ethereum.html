            <h1>ETHEREUM</h1>
        <p1>Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain-based software that has smart contract functionality.<br> Ethereum is open source and used primarily to support the second-largest cryptocurrency in the  world known as Ether.  Ethereum enables the smart contracts and applications built on its blockchain <br>to run smoothly without fraud, downtime, control, or any third-party interference.<br></p1>            
            <p2>Ethereum aims to provide a system that gives users more control over their data,<br> and it also allows for applications to be built and run on the blockchain. To run these applications and have this level of control on the Ethereum platform, it requires Ether. <br>The more the number of people making use of the platform, the higher the fees.</p2>
            
           <p3>As a result, essential data such as users’<br> financial data of various <br>applications are stored on servers controlled<br> by these third parties.<br> This implies that the third parties<br> are in control of the data and can do anything <br>with and to the data without the user’s consent.<br> Furthermore, it poses a considerable risk towards hacker attacks.</p3>
