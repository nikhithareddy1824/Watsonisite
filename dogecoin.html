            <h1>DOGECOIN</h1>
        <p1>Dogecoin can be used for making payments and purchases but has not been an effective store of value cryptocurrency.<br> This is due to an infinite number of Dogecoins that can be created, making the cryptocurrency highly inflationary by design.<br>Dogecoin (DOGE) is an open-source, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency<br> that was made as a parody of the crypto<br> market following the establishment of Bitcoin. It was originally created as a light-hearted joke for crypto enthusiasts,<br> but it quickly exploded to be one of the leading cryptocurrencies in use today.</p1>            
            <p2>Dogecoin can be purchased on various cryptocurrency exchanges.<br> Hence, the first step to buy Dogecoin is to open an<br> online account with a cryptocurrency exchange that supports DOGE.<br> The account will need to be funded through U.S. <br>dollars or cryptocurrencies.</p2>
            
           <p3>Dogecoin mining has mainly been unprofitable due to its low value. <br>However, the recent increase in the DOGE price has presented <br>opportunities for miners.<br> It is crucial to bear in mind the volatility of the DOGE<br> when attempting to start mining it.</p3>
